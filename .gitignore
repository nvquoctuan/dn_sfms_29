## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
#
# vendor/Pods/

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/yarn-error.log
yarn-debug.log*
.yarn-integrity
/doc/
/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/vendor
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset
/test
/.vscode
/db/seed.rb

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
/node_modules
/public
/Gemfile.lock
/config/application.yml
config/settings.local.yml
config/settings/*.local.yml
config/environments/*.local.yml

# Ignore application configuration
/config/application.yml
